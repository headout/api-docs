### `inventory`

Represents the inventory specification.

KEY | TYPE | NULL/EMPTY | DESCRIPTION
--- | --- | --- | ---
startDateTime | string | no | Start local date time for the inventory. This may even specify the opening local date time for the variant. *Format: [fm-date-time](/conventions/formats.md#fm-date-time)*. *Ref: [`inventory.startDateTime`](#inventory.startDateTime)*
endDateTime | string | no | End local date time for the inventory. This may even specify the closing local date time for the variant.  *Format: [fm-date-time](/conventions/formats.md#fm-date-time)*. *Ref: [`inventory.endDateTime`](#inventory.endDateTime)*
availability | enum | no | Specifies the type of availability for the inventory. `enum: LIMITED, UNLIMITED, CLOSED`. *Ref: [`inventory.availability`](#inventory.availability)*
remaining | int | no | The total number of seats left which can be booked for this inventory.
pricing | [`pricing`](#pricing) | no | The pricing specifiction for the inventory.

##### <a name="inventory.startDateTime"></a>`inventory.startDateTime`

This denotes the start time of the inventory for the variant concerned, if the variant has an `inventoryType` of `FIXED_START_FIXED_DURATION` or `FIXED_START_FLEXIBLE_DURATION`.

If the `inventoryType` is `FLEXIBLE_START_FIXED_DURATION` or `FLEXIBLE_START_FLEXIBLE_DURATION`, then it means that the variant does not have a fixed start time ever. In such a case this can be interpreted as the opening time for the variant's inventory. For eg: Disneyland will have an `inventoryType` of `FLEXIBLE_START_FLEXIBLE_DURATION` and it's `startDateTime` will be 8:00am which signifies it's opening time. If this inventory is bought, the customer can still enter after 8:00am.

*Ref: [`product-variant.inventoryType`](product-models.md#product-variant.inventoryType)*

##### <a name="inventory.endDateTime"></a>`inventory.endDateTime`

This denotes the end time of the inventory for the variant concerned, if the variant has an `inventoryType` of `FIXED_START_FIXED_DURATION`.

If the `inventoryType` is `FIXED_START_FLEXIBLE_DURATION`, `FLEXIBLE_START_FIXED_DURATION` or `FLEXIBLE_START_FLEXIBLE_DURATION`, then it means that the variant does not have a fixed end time ever. In such a case this can be interpreted as the closing time for the variant's inventory. For eg: A Hot-air balloon ride might have an `inventoryType` of `FLEXIBLE_START_FIXED_DURATION` and it's `endDateTime` will be 7:00pm which signifies it's end time. If this inventory is bought, the customer can enter anytime after the `startDateTime` and before `endDateTime` the the hot air balloon ride being of fixed duration.
